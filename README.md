> _Predicting the occupancy rate of public transportation buses at bus stops using transformer-based models._

The main goal of this project is to predict the occupancy rate of public transportation buses at bus stops by using transformer-based models. The model will integrate various features extracted from the trip data, including but not limited to: Temporal Data, Route and Vehicle Information, Passenger Metrics, Operational Details, Service Disruptions, and Stop-Level Data. By leveraging these inputs, the model aims to forecast occupancy levels with high accuracy, thereby facilitating improved operational decision-making and enhanced service planning.

### Project Structure

##### 1. Pytorch Model

The pytorch model is located in the [pytorch-model](pytorch-model) folder. The model is trained using the `train.py` script.
More information about the model can be found in the [README](pytorch-model/README.md) file.
